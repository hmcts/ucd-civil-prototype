      <p>Your application has been sent to the court. </p>

      <p>We'll ask Jan Clark to confirm you made the payment. They have 14 days to respond. We'll let you know when they do.</p>

      <h3 class="heading-small">If the claimant agrees you paid</h3>

      <p>Your CCJ will be marked as paid or 'satisfied' on public records. It takes 2 days for the register to update.</p>
      <p>You can then request a 'certificate of satisfaction' if you need one. It costs £15.</p>
      <p>If the claimant doesn't respond after 14 days the court will accept that you paid the claim.</p>

      <h3 class="heading-small">If the claimant doesn't agree you paid</h3>
      <p>The court will review your application and any evidence you've given. It normally takes about 2 weeks. We'll let you know when they've made a decision.</p>
