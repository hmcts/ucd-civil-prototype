    <h2 class="heading-medium">What happens next</h2>

    <p>Your application has been sent to the court. You may need to go to a hearing. We'll let you know when the court has made a decision. This takes up to 2 weeks.</p>

    <h3 class="heading-medium">If your application is successful</h3>
    <p>Your CCJ will be removed from public records. In most cases you'll still have to respond to the claim.</p>

    <p>The judge might ask the claimant to refund your fee of Â£255.</p>

    <h3 class="heading-medium">If your application is unsuccessful</h3>
    <p>You might have to pay the claimant's costs if it goes to a hearing. The CCJ will stay on the register for 6 years.</p>
