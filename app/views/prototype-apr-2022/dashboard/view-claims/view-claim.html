        Claim details
      </h1>
      <p class=""><span class="bold">Claim number:</span> 391-BK65</p>
      <p class=""><span class="bold">Amount:</span> £1,500</p>
      <p class="bold">Reason for claim:</p>
      <p>This claim is about building works.</p>
      <p>Mary Richards and I signed a contract for building works on my roof. The work on the roof was completed but
        there was a problem with one section. I asked Mary Richards to get the problem fixed, but didn't get a
      reply.</p> <p>I'll have to get another builder to rectify the problem which will cost me £1,430.</P> <p>Therefore, I'm making a money
      claim for £1,500 to compensate for the money I'm going to need to spend on the roof and also the claim fee.</p>
