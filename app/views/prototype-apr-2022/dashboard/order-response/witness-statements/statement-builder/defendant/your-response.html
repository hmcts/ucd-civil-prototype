          <h2 class="heading-small">Why you dispute the claim  </h2>
          <p>{{ partyName( 'defendant' ) }} and I signed a contract for building works on our roof. The work on the roof was completed but there was a problem with one section. I asked {{ partyName( 'defendant' ) }} to get the problem fixed, but hadn't had a reply.</p>
          <p>I'll have to get another builder to rectify the problem which will cost me £1,500.</p>
          <p>Therefore, I'm making a money claim for £1,500 to compensate for the extra money I am going to need to spend.</p>
