        Volunteer to try new features

      <p>We're continuously improving this service and trialling new features to reduce the need for paper forms.</p>

      <h4 class="heading-small">If you volunteer</h4>

    <p>We'll tell you if we select your claim - we won't select all claims.</p>

    <h4 class="heading-small">If your claim is selected</h4>

      <p>You'll be able to try new features we've already launched. We may also select your claim to trial new features we launch in future.</p>
