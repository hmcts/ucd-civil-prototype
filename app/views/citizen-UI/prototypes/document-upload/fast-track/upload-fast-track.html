        Upload your documents
      </h1>

      <p>
        Check the order the court sent you for what documents you need to upload for your case.
        <br><br>
        You cannot withdraw a document once you have submitted it. If you want to add more information to something you have already uploaded, you can upload the document again and add a version number to the name, for example ‘version 2’.
        <br><br>
        The other parties will be able to see the documents you have uploaded, and you will be able to see their documents.

        Deadlines for uploading documents
      </h2>

      <p>
        Check the order the court sent you for the deadlines for uploading your documents. If you upload a document after the deadline, you will have to apply to the court to use it at the hearing and the judge will decide if it can be accepted.
        <br><br>
        You do not have to upload all your documents at once. You can return to upload them later.
