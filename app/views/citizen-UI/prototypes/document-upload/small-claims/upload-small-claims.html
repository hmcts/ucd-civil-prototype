        Upload your documents
      </h1>

      <p>
        Check the order the court sent you for what documents you need to upload for your case.
        <br><br>
        You cannot withdraw a document once you have submitted it. If you want to add more information to something you have already submitted, you can upload the document again. You should add a version number to the name, for example ‘version 2’.
        <br><br>
        The other parties will be able to see the documents you have uploaded, and you will be able to see their documents.
      </p>

        Deadlines for uploading documents
      </h2>

      <p>
        Check the order the court sent you for the deadlines for uploading your documents. 
        <br><br>
        If you upload a document after the deadline, you will have to apply to the court to use it at the hearing and the judge will decide if it can be accepted. Use <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/form-n244-application-notice">form N244 ‘application notice’</a> to ask the court to consider a document you have uploaded after the deadline.
        <br><br>
        You do not have to upload all your documents at once. You can return to upload them later.
      </p>

      <h2 class="govuk-heading-l">
        Before you upload your documents 
      </h2>

      <p>
       Before you upload the document, give it a name that tells the court what it is, for example ‘Witness statement by Jane Smith’.
        <br><br>
        Each document must be less than 100MB. You can upload the following file types: Word, Excel, PowerPoint, PDF, RTF, TXT, CSV, JPG, JPEG, PNG, BMP, TIF, TIFF.
