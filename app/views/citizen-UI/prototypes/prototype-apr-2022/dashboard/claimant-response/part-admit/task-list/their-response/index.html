      The defendant's response
    </h1>

      <p>Mary Richards admits they owe you  £{{ data['owe-amount'] or '1200' }}. They don't believe they owe the full amount claimed.</p>

      {% if data['radio-pay-group'] == 'Set-date' %}
      <p>They've offered to pay you by {{ now | date( 'add', 3, 'months') | date }}. This is the total amount you'll be paid, including the claim fee and interest if applicable.</p>
      {% elseif data['radio-pay-group'] == 'Immediately' %}
      <p>They've offered to pay you immediately. This is the total amount you'll be paid, including the claim fee and interest if applicable.</p>
      {% else %}
      <p>They've offered to pay you in instalments. This is the total amount you'll be paid, including the claim fee and interest if applicable.</p>

    <h2 class="heading-medium">Their defence</h2>
    <p class="heading-small">Why they say they don't owe the amount claimed</p>
    <p>Because the value of the work is £{{ data['owe-amount'] or '1200' }} not £1500.</p>

        <p>I didn't get an email from Jan about this, so I didn't get a chance to sort it out. It would be good to see a
