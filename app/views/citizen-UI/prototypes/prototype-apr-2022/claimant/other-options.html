                Before you make a money claim
            </h1>

            <p>In some situations a money claim might not be your only or best option</p>

            <h2 class="heading-medium">Talk to the person who owes you</h2>

            <p>Before you make a claim it's a good idea to try to sort out the situation with the person who owes
                first.</p>

            <ul class="list list-bullet">
                <li>Contact them - you can just speak to them, or <a
                        href="http://www.which.co.uk/consumer-rights/letter/letter-before-small-claims-court-claim">send an email or letter</a> if you’d like to have a
                    record.
                </li>
                <li>Tell them what you believe they owe you and why.</li>
                <li>Explain that if you can't reach an agreement (such as a timetable for paying the money) you'll make an
                    official money claim.
                </li>
                <li>Tell them that they might have to pay the full amount as well as <a
                        href="https://www.gov.uk/court-fees-what-they-are">fees
                    and other costs</a> if they
                    ‘defend the claim’, and that they could get a <a href="https://www.gov.uk/county-court-judgments-ccj-for-debt/overview">County Court Judgment (CCJ)</a>.
                </li>
            </uL>

            <p>It could count against you in court if you don’t try to sort out the dispute with the person directly,
                before you make an official claim.</p>

            <h2 class="heading-medium">Unpaid invoices and flight delays</h2>

            <p>The best way to make a claim depends on the type of claim you’re making:</p>

            <p><a href="#"><a href="https://www.gov.uk/employment-tribunals/when-you-can-claim">Employment tribunals</a></p>
            <p><a href="#"><a href="https://www.gov.uk/late-commercial-payments-interest-debt-recovery/when-a-payment-becomes-late">Late payment of invoices</a></p>
            <p><a href="#"><a href="https://www.caa.co.uk/Passengers/Resolving-travel-problems/Delays-cancellations/Making-a-claim/Claiming-for-costs-and-compensation/">Airline claims</a></p>
            <p>You might be able to use <a href="https://www.resolver.co.uk/">Resolver</a> which will guide you through reclaiming money from
                organisations like utility companies, airlines and shops.</p>

            <h2 class="heading-medium">Mediation</h2>
            <p>A <a href="http://civilmediation.justice.gov.uk/">mediation service</a> could be quicker and cheaper than going to court. <p>Mediation is when
                an impartial
                person helps both sides work out an agreement. You can often do this over the phone. And if you don’t want to
                speak to the person you're claiming against a mediator can speak to you separately.</p>
